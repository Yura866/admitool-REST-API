Hi,  Pagantis team !!!

I have added new features to the application such as removing users and creating new portfolios,
and some features are not implemented in the front-end part, such as creating and editing new user, deleting user's wallets ...ect. 
I have added them to the TODO list, for the future.).  

The storage Layer was implemented with Java SQL database H2 .
The Unit tests needs the connection with server before do that.
